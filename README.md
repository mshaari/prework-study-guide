## Usage

The Prework Study Guide is a usefool tool for seeing a distilled version of the main concepts learned in the prework. It outlines the topic we learned ‚ÄîHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git‚Äî and provides some key, quick-facts on those topics. We exclude examples to keep the study guide as concise as possible. If you open "index.html" in Chrome and open DevTools console, you will see the "script.js" file at work, listing the topics we learned and choosing one topic for us to study first.
